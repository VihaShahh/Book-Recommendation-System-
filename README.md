# Book-Recommendation-System-

Hello Connections! 👋🌟

I'm excited to share my latest project with you all, named "Book Recommender." 📚✨

In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built a book recommendation system using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Here are the key highlights along with appropriate emojis:

1. *Data Import and Cleaning:* ✅🔍 Successfully imported a dataset containing book information, including titles, authors, ratings, and more. Ensured data cleanliness by handling missing values.

2. *Top 10 Highly Rated Books:* 📊📈 Identified and visualized the top 10 books with the highest average ratings. It's always great to know which books are highly acclaimed! 🌟📖

3. *Top 10 Authors with Most Books:* 📚👑 Explored and visualized the top 10 authors who have written the most books. A tribute to prolific writers! 🖋️👏

4. *Top 10 Most Rated Books:* 🌟📊 Uncovered and visualized the top 10 books with the most ratings. These are the books that have captured readers' attention the most! 📈📚

5. *Average Rating Distribution:* 📊📈 Plotted a distribution of average ratings to understand how ratings are distributed across all books. 🤔📊

6. *Rating vs. Ratings Count:* 📈📉 Explored the relationship between average ratings and the number of ratings. 🤝🌟

7. *Book Recommendation System:* 📖🤝 Built a book recommendation system using k-nearest neighbors. It suggests similar books to a given book title. 📚🔗

For example, when I input "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," the system suggests books like "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" and "The Fellowship of the Ring."
